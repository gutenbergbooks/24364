<h2 id="defeat">THE DEFEAT OF YOUTH <img src="images/leaf.gif" height="13" width="30" alt="" /></h2>
<h3>I. UNDER THE TREES.</h3>

<p class="poem">
<img class="floatl" src="images/t.gif" height="100" width="100" alt="T" />
<span class="smcap">here</span> had been phantoms, pale-remembered shapes<br />
Of this and this occasion, sisterly<br />
In their resemblances, each effigy<br />
Crowned with the same bright hair above the nape's<br />
White rounded firmness, and each body alert<br />
With such swift loveliness, that very rest<br />
Seemed a poised movement: ... phantoms that impressed<br />
But a faint influence and could bless or hurt<br />
No more than dreams. And these ghost things were she;<br />
For formless still, without identity,<br />
Not one she seemed, not clear, but many and dim.<br />
One face among the legions of the street,<br />
Indifferent mystery, she was for him<br />
Something still uncreated, incomplete.</p>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p class="poem">
Bright windy sunshine and the shadow of cloud<br />
Quicken the heavy summer to new birth<br />
Of life and motion on the drowsing earth;<br />
The huge elms stir, till all the air is loud<br />
With their awakening from the muffled sleep<br />
Of long hot days. And on the wavering line<br />
That marks the alternate ebb of shade and shine,<br />
Under the trees, a little group is deep<br />
In laughing talk. The shadow as it flows<br />
Across them dims the lustre of a rose,<br />
Quenches the bright clear gold of hair, the green<br />
Of a girl's dress, and life seems faint. The light<br />
Swings back, and in the rose a fire is seen,<br />
Gold hair's aflame and green grows emerald bright.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p class="poem">She leans, and there is laughter in the face<br />
She turns towards him; and it seems a door<br />
Suddenly opened on some desolate place<br />
With a burst of light and music. What before<br />
Was hidden shines in loveliness revealed.<br />
Now first he sees her beautiful, and knows<br />
That he must love her; and the doom is sealed<br />
Of all his happiness and all the woes<br />
That shall be born of pregnant years hereafter.<br />
The swift poise of a head, a flutter of laughter&mdash;<br />
And love flows in on him, its vastness pent<br />
Within his narrow life: the pain it brings,<br />
Boundless; for love is infinite discontent<br />
With the poor lonely life of transient things.</p>

<h3>IV.</h3>

<p class="poem">Men see their god, an immanence divine,<br />
Smile through the curve of flesh or moulded clay,<br />
In bare ploughed lands that go sloping away<br />
To meet the sky in one clean exquisite line.<br />
Out of the short-seen dawns of ecstasy<br />
They draw new beauty, whence new thoughts are born<br />
And in their turn conceive, as grains of corn<br />
Germ and create new life and endlessly<br />
Shall live creating. Out of earthly seeds<br />
Springs the aerial flower. One spirit proceeds<br />
Through change, the same in body and in soul&mdash;<br />
The spirit of life and love that triumphs still<br />
In its slow struggle towards some far-off goal<br />
Through lust and death and the bitterness of will.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<h3>V.</h3>

<p class="poem">One spirit it is that stirs the fathomless deep<br />
Of human minds, that shakes the elms in storm,<br />
That sings in passionate music, or on warm<br />
Still evenings bosoms forth the tufted sleep<br />
Of thistle-seeds that wait a travelling wind.<br />
One spirit shapes the subtle rhythms of thought<br />
And the long thundering seas; the soul is wrought<br />
Of one stuff with the body&mdash;matter and mind<br />
Woven together in so close a mesh<br />
That flowers may blossom into a song, that flesh<br />
May strangely teach the loveliest holiest things<br />
To watching spirits. Truth is brought to birth<br />
Not in some vacant heaven: its beauty springs<br />
From the dear bosom of material earth.</p>

<h3>VI. IN THE HAY-LOFT.</h3>

<p class="poem">The darkness in the loft is sweet and warm<br />
With the stored hay ... darkness intensified<br />
By one bright shaft that enters through the wide<br />
Tall doors from under fringes of a storm<br />
Which makes the doomed sun brighter. On the hay,<br />
Perched mountain-high they sit, and silently<br />
Watch the motes dance and look at the dark sky<br />
And mark how heartbreakingly far away<br />
And yet how close and clear the distance seems,<br />
While all at hand is cloud&mdash;brightness of dreams<br />
Unrealisable, yet seen so clear,<br />
So only just beyond the dark. They wait,<br />
Scarce knowing what they wait for, half in fear;<br />
Expectance draws the curtain from their fate.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<h3>VII.</h3>

<p class="poem">The silence of the storm weighs heavily<br />
On their strained spirits: sometimes one will say<br />
Some trivial thing as though to ward away<br />
Mysterious powers, that imminently lie<br />
In wait, with the strong exorcising grace<br />
Of everyday's futility. Desire<br />
Becomes upon a sudden a crystal fire,<br />
Defined and hard:&mdash;If he could kiss her face,<br />
Could kiss her hair! As if by chance, her hand<br />
Brushes on his ... Ah, can she understand?<br />
Or is she pedestalled above the touch<br />
Of his desire? He wonders: dare he seek<br />
From her that little, that infinitely much?<br />
And suddenly she kissed him on the cheek.</p>

<h3>VIII. MOUNTAINS.</h3>

<p class="poem">A stronger gust catches the cloud and twists<br />
A spindle of rifted darkness through its heart,<br />
A gash in the damp grey, which, thrust apart,<br />
Reveals black depths a moment. Then the mists<br />
Shut down again; a white uneasy sea<br />
Heaves round the climbers and beneath their feet.<br />
He strains on upwards through the wind and sleet,<br />
Poised, or swift moving, or laboriously<br />
Lifting his weight. And if he should let go,<br />
What would he find down there, down there below<br />
The curtain of the mist? What would he find<br />
Beyond the dim and stifling now and here,<br />
Beneath the unsettled turmoil of his mind?<br />
Oh, there were nameless depths: he shrank with fear.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<h3>IX.</h3>

<p class="poem">The hills more glorious in their coat of snow<br />
Rise all around him, in the valleys run<br />
Bright streams, and there are lakes that catch the sun,<br />
And sunlit fields of emerald far below<br />
That seem alive with inward light. In smoke<br />
The far horizons fade; and there is peace<br />
On everything, a sense of blessed release<br />
From wilful strife. Like some prophetic cloak<br />
The spirit of the mountains has descended<br />
On all the world, and its unrest is ended.<br />
Even the sea, glimpsed far away, seems still,<br />
Hushed to a silver peace its storm and strife.<br />
Mountains of vision, calm above fate and will,<br />
You hold the promise of the freer life.</p>

<h3>X. IN THE LITTLE ROOM.</h3>

<p class="poem">London unfurls its incense-coloured dusk<br />
Before the panes, rich but a while ago<br />
With the charred gold and the red ember-glow<br />
Of dying sunset. Houses quit the husk<br />
Of secrecy, which, through the day, returns<br />
A blank to all enquiry: but at nights<br />
The cheerfulness of fire and lamp invites<br />
The darkness inward, curious of what burns<br />
With such a coloured life when all is dead&mdash;<br />
The daylight world outside, with overhead<br />
White clouds, and where we walk, the blaze<br />
Of wet and sunlit streets, shops and the stream<br />
Of glittering traffic&mdash;all that the nights erase,<br />
Colour and speed, surviving but in dream.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<h3>XI.</h3>

<p class="poem">Outside the dusk, but in the little room<br />
All is alive with light, which brightly glints<br />
On curving cup or the stiff folds of chintz,<br />
Evoking its own whiteness. Shadows loom,<br />
Bulging and black, upon the walls, where hang<br />
Rich coloured plates of beauties that appeal<br />
Less to the sense of sight than to the feel,<br />
So moistly satin are their breasts. A pang,<br />
Almost of pain, runs through him when he sees<br />
Hanging, a homeless marvel, next to these,<br />
The silken breastplate of a mandarin,<br />
Centuries dead, which he had given her.<br />
Exquisite miracle, when men could spin<br />
Jay's wing and belly of the kingfisher!</p>

<h3>XII.</h3>

<p class="poem">In silence and as though expectantly<br />
She crouches at his feet, while he caresses<br />
His light-drawn fingers with the touch of tresses<br />
Sleeked round her head, close-banded lustrously,<br />
Save where at nape and temple the smooth brown<br />
Sleaves out into a pale transparent mist<br />
Of hair and tangled light. So to exist,<br />
Poised 'twixt the deep of thought where spirits drown<br />
Life in a void impalpable nothingness,<br />
And, on the other side, the pain and stress<br />
Of clamorous action and the gnawing fire<br />
Of will, focal upon a point of earth&mdash;even thus<br />
To sit, eternally without desire<br />
And yet self-known, were happiness for us.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<h3>XIII.</h3>

<p class="poem">She turns her head and in a flash of laughter<br />
Looks up at him: and helplessly he feels<br />
That life has circled with returning wheels<br />
Back to a starting-point. Before and after<br />
Merge in this instant, momently the same:<br />
For it was thus she leaned and laughing turned<br />
When, manifest, the spirit of beauty burned<br />
In her young body with an inward flame,<br />
And first he knew and loved her. In full tide<br />
Life halts within him, suddenly stupefied.<br />
Sight blackness, lightning-struck; but blindly tender<br />
He draws her up to meet him, and she lies<br />
Close folded by his arms in glad surrender,<br />
Smiling, and with drooped head and half closed eyes.</p>

<h3>XIV.</h3>

<p class="poem">"I give you all; would that I might give more."<br />
He sees the colour dawn across her cheeks<br />
And die again to white; marks as she speaks<br />
The trembling of her lips, as though she bore<br />
Some sudden pain and hardly mastered it.<br />
Within his arms he feels her shuddering,<br />
Piteously trembling like some wild wood-thing<br />
Caught unawares. Compassion infinite<br />
Mounts up within him. Thus to hold and keep<br />
And comfort her distressed, lull her to sleep<br />
And gently kiss her brow and hair and eyes<br />
Seems love perfected&mdash;templed high and white<br />
Against the calm of golden autumn skies,<br />
And shining quenchlessly with vestal light.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<h3>XV.</h3>

<p class="poem">But passion ambushed by the aerial shrine<br />
Comes forth to dance, a hoofed obscenity,<br />
His satyr's dance, with laughter in his eye,<br />
And cruelty along the scarlet line<br />
Of his bright smiling mouth. All uncontrolled,<br />
Love's rebel servant, he delights to beat<br />
The maddening quick dry rhythm of goatish feet<br />
Even in the sanctuary, and makes bold<br />
To mime himself the godhead of the place.<br />
He turns in terror from her trance-calmed face,<br />
From the white-lidded languor of her eyes,<br />
From lips that passion never shook before,<br />
But glad in the promise of her sacrifice:<br />
"I give you all; would that I might give more."</p>

<h3>XVI.</h3>

<p class="poem">He is afraid, seeing her lie so still,<br />
So utterly his own; afraid lest she<br />
Should open wide her eyes and let him see<br />
The passionate conquest of her virgin will<br />
Shine there in triumph, starry-bright with tears.<br />
He thrusts her from him: face and hair and breast,<br />
Hands he had touched, lips that his lips had pressed,<br />
Seem things deadly to be desired. He fears<br />
Lest she should body forth in palpable shame<br />
Those dreams and longings that his blood, aflame<br />
Through the hot dark of summer nights, had dreamed<br />
And longed. Must all his love, then, turn to this?<br />
Was lust the end of what so pure had seemed?<br />
He must escape, ah God! her touch, her kiss.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<h3>XVII. IN THE PARK.</h3>

<p class="poem">Laughing, "To-night," I said to him, "the Park<br />
Has turned the garden of a symbolist.<br />
Those old great trees that rise above the mist,<br />
Gold with the light of evening, and the dark<br />
Still water, where the dying sun evokes<br />
An echoed glory&mdash;here I recognize<br />
Those ancient gardens mirrored by the eyes<br />
Of poets that hate the world of common folks,<br />
Like you and me and that thin pious crowd,<br />
Which yonder sings its hymns, so humbly proud<br />
Of holiness. The garden of escape<br />
Lies here; a small green world, and still the bride<br />
Of quietness, although an imminent rape<br />
Roars ceaselessly about on every side."</p>

<h3>XVIII.</h3>

<p class="poem">I had forgotten what I had lightly said,<br />
And without speech, without a thought I went,<br />
Steeped in that golden quiet, all content<br />
To drink the transient beauty as it sped<br />
Out of eternal darkness into time<br />
To light and burn and know itself a fire;<br />
Yet doomed&mdash;ah, fate of the fulfilled desire!&mdash;<br />
To fade, a meteor, paying for the crime<br />
Of living glorious in the denser air<br />
Of our material earth. A strange despair,<br />
An agony, yet strangely, subtly sweet<br />
And tender as an unpassionate caress,<br />
Filled me ... Oh laughter! youth's conceit<br />
Grown almost conscious of youth's feebleness!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<h3>XIX.</h3>

<p class="poem">He spoke abrupt across my dream: "Dear Garden,<br />
A stranger to your magic peace, I stand<br />
Beyond your walls, lost in a fevered land<br />
Of stones and fire. Would that the gods would harden<br />
My soul against its torment, or would blind<br />
Those yearning glimpses of a life at rest<br />
In perfect beauty&mdash;glimpses at the best<br />
Through unpassed bars. And here, without, the wind<br />
Of scattering passion blows: and women pass<br />
Glitter-eyed down putrid alleys where the glass<br />
Of some grimed window suddenly parades&mdash;<br />
Ah, sickening heart-beat of desire!&mdash;the grace<br />
Of bare and milk-warm flesh: the vision fades,<br />
And at the pane shows a blind tortured face."</p>

<h3>XX. SELF-TORMENT.</h3>

<p class="poem">The days pass by, empty of thought and will:<br />
His thought grows stagnant at its very springs,<br />
With every channel on the world of things<br />
Dammed up, and thus, by its long standing still,<br />
Poisons itself and sickens to decay.<br />
All his high love for her, his fair desire,<br />
Loses its light; and a dull rancorous fire,<br />
Burning darkness and bitterness that prey<br />
Upon his heart are left. His spirit burns<br />
Sometimes with hatred, or the hatred turns<br />
To a fierce lust for her, more cruel than hate,<br />
Till he is weary wrestling with its force:<br />
And evermore she haunts him, early and late,<br />
As pitilessly as an old remorse.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<h3>XXI.</h3>

<p class="poem">Streets and the solitude of country places<br />
Were once his friends. But as a man born blind,<br />
Opening his eyes from lovely dreams, might find<br />
The world a desert and men's larval faces<br />
So hateful, he would wish to seek again<br />
The darkness and his old chimeric sight<br />
Of beauties inward&mdash;so, that fresh delight,<br />
Vision of bright fields and angelic men,<br />
That love which made him all the world, is gone.<br />
Hating and hated now, he stands alone,<br />
An island-point, measureless gulfs apart<br />
From other lives, from the old happiness<br />
Of being more than self, when heart to heart<br />
Gave all, yet grew the greater, not the less.</p>

<h3>XXII. THE QUARRY IN THE WOOD.</h3>

<p class="poem">Swiftly deliberate, he seeks the place.<br />
A small wind stirs, the copse is bright in the sun:<br />
Like quicksilver the shine and shadow run<br />
Across the leaves. A bramble whips his face,<br />
The tears spring fast, and through the rainbow mist<br />
He sees a world that wavers like the flame<br />
Of a blown candle. Tears of pain and shame,<br />
And lips that once had laughed and sung and kissed<br />
Trembling in the passion of his sobbing breath!<br />
The world a candle shuddering to its death,<br />
And life a darkness, blind and utterly void<br />
Of any love or goodness: all deceit,<br />
This friendship and this God: all shams destroyed,<br />
And truth seen now.<br />
<span class="poem1">Earth fails beneath his feet.</span></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="song">SONG OF POPLARS <img src="images/leaf.gif" height="13" width="30" alt="" /></h2>

<p class="poem">
<img class="floatl" src="images/s.gif" height="100" width="100" alt="S" />
<span class="smcap">hepherd</span>, to yon tall poplars tune your flute:<br />
Let them pierce, keenly, subtly shrill,<br />
The slow blue rumour of the hill;<br />
Let the grass cry with an anguish of evening gold,<br />
And the great sky be mute.</p>

<p class="poem">Then hearken how the poplar trees unfold<br />
Their buds, yet close and gummed and blind,<br />
In airy leafage of the mind,<br />
Rustling in silvery whispers the twin-hued scales<br />
That fade not nor grow old.</p>

<p class="poem">"Poplars and fountains and you cypress spires<br />
Springing in dark and rusty flame,<br />
Seek you aught that hath a name?<br />
Or say, say: Are you all an upward agony<br />
Of undefined desires?</p>

<p class="poem">"Say, are you happy in the golden march<br />
Of sunlight all across the day?<br />
Or do you watch the uncertain way<br />
That leads the withering moon on cloudy stairs<br />
Over the heaven's wide arch?</p>

<p class="poem">"Is it towards sorrow or towards joy you lift<br />
The sharpness of your trembling spears?<br />
Or do you seek, through the grey tears<br />
That blur the sky, in the heart of the triumphing blue,<br />
A deeper, calmer rift?"</p>

<p class="poem">So; I have tuned my music to the trees,<br />
And there were voices, dim below<br />
Their shrillness, voices swelling slow<br />
In the blue murmur of hills, and a golden cry<br />
And then vast silences.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="reef">THE REEF <img src="images/leaf.gif" height="13" width="30" alt="" /></h2>

<p class="poem">
<img class="floatl" src="images/m.gif" height="100" width="100" alt="M" />
<span class="smcap">y</span> green aquarium of phantom fish,<br />
Goggling in on me through the misty panes;<br />
My rotting leaves and fields spongy with rains;<br />
My few clear quiet autumn days&mdash;I wish</p>

<p class="poem">I could leave all, clearness and mistiness;<br />
Sodden or goldenly crystal, all too still.<br />
Yes, and I too rot with the leaves that fill<br />
The hollows in the woods; I am grown less</p>

<p class="poem">Than human, listless, aimless as the green<br />
Idiot fishes of my aquarium,<br />
Who loiter down their dim tunnels and come<br />
And look at me and drift away, nought seen</p>

<p class="poem">Or understood, but only glazedly<br />
Reflected. Upwards, upwards through the shadows,<br />
Through the lush sponginess of deep-sea meadows<br />
Where hare-lipped monsters batten, let me ply</p>

<p class="poem">Winged fins, bursting this matrix dark to find<br />
Jewels and movement, mintage of sunlight<br />
Scattered largely by the profuse wind,<br />
And gulfs of blue brightness, too deep for sight.</p>

<p class="poem">Free, newly born, on roads of music and air<br />
Speeding and singing, I shall seek the place<br />
Where all the shining threads of water race,<br />
Drawn in green ropes and foamy meshes. There,</p>

<p class="poem">On the red fretted ramparts of a tower<br />
Of coral rooted in the depths, shall break<br />
An endless sequence of joy and speed and power:<br />
Green shall shatter to foam; flake with white flake</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p class="poem">Shall create an instant's shining constellation<br />
Upon the blue; and all the air shall be<br />
Full of a million wings that swift and free<br />
Laugh in the sun, all power and strong elation.</p>

<p class="poem">Yes, I shall seek that reef, which is beyond<br />
All isles however magically sleeping<br />
In tideless seas, uncharted and unconned<br />
Save by blind eyes; beyond the laughter and weeping</p>

<p class="poem">That brood like a cloud over the lands of men.<br />
Movement, passion of colour and pure wings,<br />
Curving to cut like knives&mdash;these are the things<br />
I search for:&mdash;passion beyond the ken</p>

<p class="poem">Of our foiled violences, and, more swift<br />
Than any blow which man aims against time,<br />
The invulnerable, motion that shall rift<br />
All dimness with the lightning of a rhyme,</p>

<p class="poem">Or note, or colour. And the body shall be<br />
Quick as the mind; and will shall find release<br />
From bondage to brute things; and joyously<br />
Soul, will and body, in the strength of triune peace,</p>

<p class="poem">Shall live the perfect grace of power unwasted.<br />
And love consummate, marvellously blending<br />
Passion and reverence in a single spring<br />
Of quickening force, till now never yet tasted,</p>

<p class="poem">But ever ceaselessly thirsted for, shall crown<br />
The new life with its ageless starry fire.<br />
I go to seek that reef, far down, far down<br />
Below the edge of everyday's desire,</p>

And hardly spoke, or framed a thought <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span><br />

Restless, we knew not how or why;<br />
And there were sudden gusts that blew<br />
Our dreaming banners into storm;<br />
We wore the uncertain crumbling form<br />

Shuddering from earth, to fall again<br />
With a dry whisper of withered rain.</p>

<p class="poem">Last, from the dead and shrunken days<br />
We conjured spring, lighting the blaze<br />
Of burnished tulips in the dark;<br />
And from black frost we struck a spark<br />

A little world of flowers and dew.<br />
Winter for us was over and done:<br />
The drought of fluttering leaves had grown<br />
Emerald shining in the sun,<br />
As light as glass, as firm as stone.<br />
Real once more: for we had passed <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span><br />
Through passion into thought again;<br />
Shaped our desires and made that fast<br />
Which was before a cloudy pain;<br />
Moulded the dimness, fixed, defined<br />
In a fair statue, strong and free,<br />
Twin bodies flaming into mind,<br />
Poised on the brink of ecstasy.</p>

Of cheeks as red as bergamot<br />

Down to the last remorseful jot.<br />

Shakes in the heat, quivers to the sound of lutes:<br />
Half shaded, half sunlit, a great bowl of fruits<br />
Glistens purple and golden: the flasks of wine<br />
Cool in their panniers of snow: silks muffle and shine:<br />
Dim velvet, where through the leaves a sunbeam shoots,<br />
Rifts in a pane of scarlet: fingers tapping the roots<br />
Keep languid time to the music's soft slow decline.</p>

<p class="poem">Suddenly from the gate rises up a cry,<br />
Hideous broken laughter, scarce human in sound;<br />
Gaunt clawed hands, thrust through the bars despairingly,<br />
Clutch fast at the scented air, while on the ground<br />
Lie the poor plague-stricken carrions, who have found<br />
Strength to crawl forth and curse the sunshine and die.</p>

Surprised, surprisingly, like a child:<br />

"What about God?" you said. "I have found<br />
Much to be said for Totality.<br />
All, I take it, is God: God's all&mdash;<br />
This bottle, for instance ..." I recall,<br />
Dimly, that you took God by the neck&mdash;<br />

With drum and brass among the crowd<br />
Of panic revellers, whose cries<br />
Affront the quiet of the skies;<br />
Whose dancing lights contract the deep<br />
Infinity of night and sleep<br />
To a narrow turmoil of troubled fire.<br />
And I have found my heart's desire<br />
In beechen caverns that autumn fills<br />
With the blue shadowiness of distant hills;<br />
Whose luminous grey pillars bear<br />
The stooping sky: calm is the air,<br />
Nor any sound is heard to mar<br />
That crystal silence&mdash;as from far,<br />
Far off a man may see<br />
The busy world all utterly<br />
Hushed as an old memorial scene.<br />
Long evenings I have sat and been<br />
Strangely content, while in my hands<br />
I held a wealth of coloured strands,<br />
Shimmering plaits of silk and skeins<br />
Of soft bright wool. Each colour drains<br />
New life at the lamp's round pool of gold;<br />
Each sinks again when I withhold<br />
The quickening radiance, to a wan<br />
And shadowy oblivion<br />
Of what it was. And in my mind<br />
Beauty or sudden love has shined<br />
And wakened colour in what was dead<br />
And turned to gold the sullen lead<br />
Of mean desires and everyday's<br />
Poor thoughts and customary ways. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span><br />
Sometimes in lands where mountains throw<br />
Their silent spell on all below,<br />
Drawing a magic circle wide<br />
About their feet on every side,<br />
Robbed of all speech and thought and act,<br />
I have seen God in the cataract.<br />
In falling water and in flame,<br />
Never at rest, yet still the same,<br />
God shows himself. And I have known<br />
The swift fire frozen into stone,<br />
And water frozen changelessly<br />
Into the death of gems. And I<br />
Long sitting by the thunderous mill<br />
Have seen the headlong wheel made still,<br />
And in the silence that ensued<br />
Have known the endless solitude<br />
Of being dead and utterly nought.<br />
Inhabitant of mine own thought,<br />
I look abroad, and all I see<br />
Is my creation, made for me:<br />
Along my thread of life are pearled<br />
The moments that make up the world.</p>

The tree's true self&mdash;proving that I have known <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span><br />
No triumph, but the shadow of a rose.<br />
But think. These nymphs, their loveliness ... suppose<br />
They bodied forth your senses' fabulous thirst?<br />
Illusion! which the blue eyes of the first,<br />
As cold and chaste as is the weeping spring,<br />
Beget: the other, sighing, passioning,<br />
Is she the wind, warm in your fleece at noon?<br />
No, through this quiet, when a weary swoon<br />
Crushes and chokes the latest faint essay<br />
Of morning, cool against the encroaching day,<br />
There is no murmuring water, save the gush<br />
Of my clear fluted notes; and in the hush<br />
Blows never a wind, save that which through my reed<br />
Puffs out before the rain of notes can speed<br />
Upon the air, with that calm breath of art<br />
That mounts the unwrinkled zenith visibly,<br />
Where inspiration seeks its native sky.<br />
You fringes of a calm Sicilian lake,<br />
The sun's own mirror which I love to take,<br />
Silent beneath your starry flowers, tell<br />
<i>How here I cut the hollow rushes, well<br />
Tamed by my skill, when on the glaucous gold<br />
Of distant lawns about their fountain cold<br />
A living whiteness stirs like a lazy wave;<br />
And at the first slow notes my panpipes gave<br />
These flocking swans, these naiads, rather, fly<br />
Or dive.</i> Noon burns inert and tawny dry,<br />
Nor marks how clean that Hymen slipped away<br />
From me who seek in song the real A.<br />
Wake, then, to the first ardour and the sight,<br />
O lonely faun, of the old fierce white light,<br />
With, lilies, one of you for innocence.<br />
Other than their lips' delicate pretence, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span><br />
The light caress that quiets treacherous lovers,<br />
My breast, I know not how to tell, discovers<br />
The bitten print of some immortal's kiss.<br />
But hush! a mystery so great as this<br />
I dare not tell, save to my double reed,<br />
Which, sharer of my every joy and need,<br />
Dreams down its cadenced monologues that we<br />
Falsely confuse the beauties that we see<br />
With the bright palpable shapes our song creates:<br />
My flute, as loud as passion modulates,<br />
Purges the common dream of flank and breast,<br />
Seen through closed eyes and inwardly caressed,<br />
Of every empty and monotonous line.</p>

<p class="poem">Bloom then, O Syrinx, in thy flight malign,<br />
A reed once more beside our trysting-lake.<br />

So when the grape's transparent juice I drain,<br />

Dream-drunk till evening, eyeing it.<br />

Bruised, being twins in love, by languor sweet,<br />
Two sleeping girls, clasped at my very feet.<br />
I seize and run with them, nor part the pair,<br />
Breaking this covert of frail petals, where<br />
Roses drink scent of the sun and our light play<br />
'Mid tumbled flowers shall match the death of day.</i><br />
I love that virginal fury&mdash;ah, the wild<br />
Thrill when a maiden body shrinks, defiled,<br />
Shuddering like arctic light, from lips that sear<br />
Its nakedness ... the flesh in secret fear!<br />
Contagiously through my linked pair it flies<br />
Where innocence in either, struggling, dies,<br />
Wet with fond tears or some less piteous dew.<br />
<i>Gay in the conquest of these fears, I grew<br />
So rash that I must needs the sheaf divide<br />
Of ruffled kisses heaven itself had tied.<br />
For as I leaned to stifle in the hair<br />
Of one my passionate laughter (taking care<br />
With a stretched finger, that her innocence<br />
Might stain with her companion's kindling sense<br />

Child-like unblushing) my ungrateful prey<br />
Slips from me, freed by passion's sudden death,<br />

<p class="poem">Let it pass! others of their hair shall twist<br />
A rope to drag me to those joys I missed.<br />
See how the ripe pomegranates bursting red<br />
To quench the thirst of the mumbling bees have bled;<br />

Flows for the swarming legions of desire.<br />
At evening, when the woodland green turns gold <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span><br />
And ashen grey, 'mid the quenched leaves, behold!<br />
Red Etna glows, by Venus visited,<br />

<p class="poem">But the unthinking soul and body swoon<br />
